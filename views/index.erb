        <h2 class="heading">Efficient Ruby on Rails Engineering</h2>
        <p>We build dedicated, multi-skilled teams that help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validate your hypotheses</li>
            <li>Launch a startup smoothly and hit the ground running</li>
            <li>Scale your operations</li>
            <li>Modernize your legacy codebase (drama-free) and foster a strong engineering culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Full³ Stack Teams</h3>
        <p>When we say "full stack", we don't just mean frontend + backend — we mean the entire product life cycle. From backend and frontend to CI, delivery, monitoring, and scaling, our compact teams of M‑shaped specialists handle it all with about half the usual headcount.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Product Engineering Center, Not a Feature Factory</h3>
        <p>We value efficiency and strive for clarity in both business and product strategy, because it helps reduce waste and keeps us focused on what truly matters.</p>
        <p>Our team will actively seek out your business goals and product metrics, ensuring we don't just build features, but help you achieve real, measurable results.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Want an In-House Team?</h3>
        <p>So you've become big enough to build your own dev team? We can help. We'll train your staff, assemble a team from scratch, or even discuss a buy-out of our developers.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Our Philosophy & Approach</h2>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">We Practice Painless Rails</h3>
        <p>A best-in-class approach to Ruby on Rails that goes beyond mere code-organization conventions. It's a comprehensive methodology backed by a strong guiding philosophy.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">We Own Every Decision</h3>
        <p>We're deliberate in our choices. For every piece of technology we adopt, we can explain why it's there; for everything we skip, we can explain why it's not.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We <strong>don't</strong> do: microservices, service objects, callbacks, mocks, monads, e2e browser tests.</li>
            <li>We <strong>don't</strong> care about code coverage.</li>
            <li>We prefer: minitest, fixtures, hotwire, kamal,</li>
            <li>We practice: Painless Rails, Application Layer, Modern Make.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">We Don't Reinvent Wheels</h3>
        <p>We use a standardized approach for key features like activity tracking, permissions, search and filtering, mass operations, import/export, reporting, and any kind of third-party integrations.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, we rely on ready-made services like ApiDeck, CsvBox, SmartCar and Imgproxy to save weeks of developer time.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">We Don't Push Against Rails Conventions</h3>
        <p>We don't fight Rails or reinvent its core components. On the contrary, we double down on what Rails does best and add our own building blocks on top to manage complexity more efficiently.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Designed to Last</h3>
        <p>We know how to tackle the common Rails pitfalls. Our approach imposes minimal overhead (you can adopt it from day one) and lays a foundation that spares you from growth-related issues—even at the scale of hundreds of models. In contrast, many projects start running into problems at just 50–100 models.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Our Tech Stack & Processes</h2>

    <div class="tech-columns">
        <div class="tech-col">
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Efficient Toolbelt to Do More with Less</h3>
            <p>We rely on multipurpose tools like GitLab, AppSignal, and PostHog — each covers multiple areas by design. By integrating them seamlessly, we gain extra synergy, ensuring maximum efficiency, control, and flexibility.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Flexible Development Process</h3>
            <p>We're not bound to a single process framework — Kanban, Scrum, or otherwise. We start lean and adapt as needed. For us, it's not about following a methodology by the book, but spotting new bottlenecks as they arise and adjusting our process to eliminate them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tech-col">
            <h3 class="sub-heading">AI-Aware and Ready</h3>
            <p>We're not rushing to replace everything with AI, but we're not ignoring it either. We run lean experiments using no-code platforms like n8n and adopt what truly proves efficient.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we're rethinking our development practices to augment our developers with even more powerful tools.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">The More Context, the Better</h3>
            <p>We rely on frameworks and tools like Customer Journey Maps, Event Storming, Wardley Mapping, AJTBD, and Service Blueprint to give our dev team deeper insight when business logic grows truly complex.</p>
